## Financial Investments

There are 2 types of investments in TrAiders: Manual investments and online investments. To be able
to make investments a user should first become a Trader and verify their e-mail address.

A user can add manual investments that they made outside of the TrAiders platform to see the profit or the loss of 
their investment. Users should provide the buy and sell amount together with the date of transaction for TrAiders to 
calculate the profit/loss value by considering the up-to-date prices.

Users can also buy and sell investment equipment directly on the platform. While investing, users have the option of 
paying with a credit card or spending directly from their assets. To invest using a credit card, a user should provide the 
equipment to be sold, the equipment to be bought and the amount they want to buy. After the payment, the desired amount
is added to their assets. If the user selects to spend from their assets, the same thing happens but this time the price 
gets subtracted from their assets. 

Users can also give buy and stop-loss orders to automatically buy or sell equipment. Giving a buy order is 
basically the same as making an online investment but the user also provides the ratio they desire. If the current ratio of the parity
drops below the desired amount, the investment happens. Stop-loss orders can be given to reverse an investment to avoid losses.

## Notifications

One can click to a notification and go to relevant page to see. If notification is not clicked before, it is showed in blue otherwise it is gray.
