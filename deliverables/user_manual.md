## Portfolio: How to follow Equipment and Parities
A Portfolio is used to follow a set of parities. 
One might need to follow different sets of parities for different financial strategies.
For this purpose, a Basic or Trader User can create his/her own portfolio with a given name, add-drop parities,
follow another user's portfolio. 

In Portfolio tab, "My Portfolios" and "Followed Portfolios" are presented.
One can also simply use Profile page to edit his or her own portfolios.

## Social Interactions with Other Users
Our Traders application is convenient for users to interact with each other, 
share their ideas and economic strategies. 

One can share an Article which is a text with or without picture. He or she can also edit or delete it.
The Articles written by users are listed in homepage and in Articles section of Social tab. 
A User can like or make comment with or without photo on an Article and other people see 
and like these comments. 

One can see the author of an Article and can follow the author directly without going to his/her Profile page. 
One might not simply follow someone if the other user's profile is private, 
then application creates a Following Request and the current user should wait 
until the other user accepts this request.

One can annotate a part of the text or part of the image in Article with a text or image. 
To annotate an image, one should click and drag, then he or she can submit an image or text.
To annotate a text, one should select the text desired to be annotated, then he/she can submit an image or text.
Annotations are colourfully shown and one can simply read annotation, learn who annotated and view even nested annotations.

An example use of text annotation can be "The previous value is %1.2" 
annotated to a part of text telling "FED will make announcement on inflation rate."

## Economic Events
An Event can be simplified to an announcement of a value by authorities in a country. 
Economic events can be seen by a User in Events section of Social tab. An event table is presented to
a User. Events have properties such as name, actual value, previous value, country etc. When an event occurs,
it means the actual value has just been announced. A User can follow an Event to be notified when this Event
occurs.

## Financial Investments

There are 2 types of investments in TrAiders: Manual investments and online investments. To be able
to make investments a user should first become a Trader and verify their e-mail address.

A user can add manual investments that they made outside of the TrAiders platform to see the profit or the loss of 
their investment. Users should provide the buy and sell amount together with the date of transaction for TrAiders to 
calculate the profit/loss value by considering the up-to-date prices.

Users can also buy and sell investment equipment directly on the platform. While investing, users have the option of 
paying with a credit card or spending directly from their assets. To invest using a credit card, a user should provide the 
equipment to be sold, the equipment to be bought and the amount they want to buy. After the payment, the desired amount
is added to their assets. If the user selects to spend from their assets, the same thing happens but this time the price 
gets subtracted from their assets. 

Users can also give buy and stop-loss orders to automatically buy or sell equipment. Giving a buy order is 
basically the same as making an online investment but the user also provides the ratio they desire. If the current ratio of the parity
drops below the desired amount, the investment happens. Stop-loss orders can be given to reverse an investment to avoid losses.

## Notifications

Notifications can only be seen when one logged in. 
Users can see number of unseen notifications on user button in navbar. 
Notifications are shown in user profile page in detail. 
One can click to a notification to see the related thing that triggered the notification.
If a notification is not clicked before, the background color is blue, otherwise gray. 

Four different reasons can trigger a notification for a User:

A user who is followed by the current user shares an article.

An economic event which the current user followed occurs.

Stop-Loss Order or Buy Order given by the current user has been implemented.

Change in a Parity value meets the condition of the alert set by the current.

## Recommendations  
In Recommendation tab, a User-specific table is presented to a User. 
In this table, a User can view the recommended Articles, Equipments, Parities, Events and Users. 
Also, the reason behind each Recommendation is presented to the User on the object recommended.

## Search

A User should type in Search tab what he or she wish to find and then a table (Articles, Equipments, Parities, Events and Users)
is presented to the User. She or he can check by object type to find the thing she/he is looking for. 

Search property can also be used to find something which is not exactly known since it implements Semantic Search algorithms and come up with a relevant results which are not exactly specified beforehand.
