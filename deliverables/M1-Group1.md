# Executive Summary

## Project Description
Our project is a traders platform for traders and enthusiasts of finance to easily keep track of everything related to finance. The easy to use interface, availability in Android and web, location-based news search makes this platform perfect for anyone, anywhere. The functionality of the platform differs for different client types. A guest user can view economic events, different aspects of trading equipment, articles and profiles of public users. This way they have a chance to improve themselves in trading by following other experienced users. Basic users can do everything a guest does and much more. They can keep track of their profit/loss by manually entering their investments, they can write articles, rate and comment articles, they can set alarms for economic events and price levels of trading equipment, they can create portfolios and they can make predictions about the price levels estimating whether the prices will drop or rise. Our privileged trader users can use the platform to buy and sell any trading equipment they want by integrating their private bank accounts to the platform. This makes it much easier to track their profits. What makes this platform unique is that it is also a social platform, where you can follow many inspiring users who will give tips on financial matters. You can comment and start discussions about finance and you can learn a lot from others.

## Project Status
At the beginning when we were assigned as a group, most of us didn’t even know each other. But even from the first meeting, we felt comfortable around each other and this made a huge positive effect on our group work. We were a group of hardworking students and we all took almost equal workloads in the project, which we believe is rare in a group project where team members are chosen randomly. As a hardworking group, we accomplished each task given by the client. Starting with the search about Git & GitHub onto our last task of preparing the UML design, we have completed every task, never flexing the deadline for more than 1-2 days. Even if we received tons of feedback, we never gave up on our project and tried to make upgrades on our work as soon as possible. So at this point of our project, we can proudly say that we have fulfilled every task that was assigned and our project is going completely as planned without any drawback.

## Moving Forward
We plan to continue with our project design and implementation, without losing our enthusiasm. We have worked hard and coherently thus far and we have seen the great results of this. We will continue to meet and evaluate our work together in our meetings and give feedback to each other to perfect our work. We believe the hard part was the design and implementation will be much easier since we are all accustomed to coding. We aim to implement the platform: backend, frontend, and Android parts. Some of us already have experience in some of these parts so we will learn from each other and the project will be very informative for us. In the end, we believe that a great product will surface and every team member will feel proud of their contribution to such a great project.

**1- GitHub Wiki:** Generally we are in a good shape. We try to keep each other and the instructors updated, using the GitHub wiki page to document all of the effort and work done. Good activity in reading out the wiki, updating in terms of both design and content weekly. Also we got a feedback about not using temporary links of files/images, but to keep it in the related folder of the repository. Considered and took action right away. Overall, the group is good at maintaining the wiki page and utilizing it to keep everyone involved. 

**2- GitHub Readme:** Got a good explanation of the work done in the readme, that explains what we are up to. 

**3- GitHub Issues:** So far good with the label usages, works as planned. As a further improvement, we are planning to get better at reviewing. We are hoping to release a “Code of Review“ to make everyone on the same page, and have a structure and plan for reviews. We are also hoping that this will let everyone be more involved and up to date about the work that is done. Also we got a feedback regarding the use of dates and links to the completed work, and started acting accordingly. Overall, we are not in a bad position but we have further things to improve for the remaining period and utilize the issues system better in CMPE451 where we get to actual coding part.

**4- Meeting Notes:** As mentioned in the Wiki part, we are using the notes to keep each other up to date. Also, we sometimes go over the previous weeks’ meeting notes to check out the work done, and status of accomplishment. There are a few things to improve, such as including that week’s lecture and PS notes in the meeting notes part. We are hoping to start working on this in the coming weeks.

**5- Communication Plan:** We are using Slack in the parts where we are divided into sub-groups. For instance when we were working with the class diagrams, we had a slack channel for that. Also we use GitHub integrated into Slack to get commit, issue updates etc. in realtime. Currently, sharing docs over Drive, using WhatsApp as a communication channel and github issues remain enough for our in-group communication. In the future, we are hoping to better utilize Slack and use more integrated tools, such as utilizing unit test tools, etc.

**6- Requirements:** Even after a few weeks than the deadline of requirements, we still keep updating the Requirements and its wiki page, both in terms of visuals and its content. As the ideas pop up in the meetings, and there are some points that need clarification, we go ahead and update the related requirement, or sometimes the whole page. Overall, we think we are in a good shape in terms of the requirements page and good at updating it according to both instructors’ and team’s feedback. Also, we often go back to requirements and refer to them in different parts of the project, such as Mockups and Design Diagrams. Hence, it is really important for us to keep this part up to date and well-explained.

**7&8- User Stories and Persona Page and Mockups:** It took 3 weeks to finalize the mockups, persona & user stories and the related design parts. It was a trial and error process, but generally all of the team members were involved with this part and everybody were involved in either creating, designing, writing or updating its’ content. We feel we did a great teamwork when it comes to Mockups. 

**9- Design Diagrams:** This part took straight 3 weeks of our time, but we feel it was worth it. Specifically preparing the use-cases and class diagrams made us understand even more about the structure of the system that we are going to build. During the design process, we obtained the idea of how to system is going to function, what operations we may need in the background, how the system is going to behave and what the user will see. It was actually an assignment, but made us aware of what we are up to so far. Hence, the group feels like this part was really beneficial and crucial. During the meetings while discussing a functionality, we often refer to class diagrams to make it more concrete and we are also utilizing it this way. 

**10- Project Plan:** We have started to prepare project plans to put in use. We are not done with this yet and this is in progress, but we started to think in terms of the time it’s going to take, and the effort it’s going to cause need for. Hence, although we haven’t delivered yet, we think we gained a lot and starting to use this measures during the meetings.

# Evaluation of Tools and Processes Used
**figma.com:** We have used Figma to design our mockups. The reason we have chosen this platform was that one of our team members already had some experience in it. He gave us a hands-on tutorial, then each assignee was able to design their part quickly. After seeing other teams’ designs, we realized that this platform was a bit too complicated and detailed for designing mockups. Still, we think that the know-how we gained will be useful in UI/UX design which we are going to do next semester. On the other hand, the free version of the Figma platform only supports 2 users to edit a design at the same time, which is very limiting considering there are 11 members in our team.

**UMLet, UMLetino:** We prepared the first version of our use case diagrams with UMLet. Besides its simplicity, it had no support for online collaboration and looked old fashioned. Therefore, we gave it up and redesigned our use case diagrams with Lucidchart after the feedback.

**lucidchart.com:** We discovered Lucidchart when watching UML diagram tutorials on YouTube. We first used it to design our class diagram and then moved our use case diagrams also. Its free education package for students gives full access to all of its functionality. It lets multiple users edit diagrams at the same time and looks very professional.

**sequencediagram.org:** We used this website to design our sequence diagrams. It features a simple programming language to create sequence diagrams with no mouse clicks. We shared sequence diagrams between several assignees, and this feature provided consistency between the diagrams that are designed by different members.
