# Project Assesment
## Teamwork
This one year long journey was particularly a teaching and enjoyable experience for us. <br>
Starting in CMPE352, most of the group members did not know each other, yet the group got to know each other very quickly and adapted to working as a team. <br>
Throughout the project, everyone had busy periods in their schedules, but the team managed to fill in for that person, and that person also compensated for that period at a later time.  <br>
Moreover, at the beginning of CMPE451, there were people leaving and joining, but the team handled the transition very smoothly. <br>
To sum up, Group 2 as a team managed to start from zero and became an actual embodiment of teamwork.
<br> 
## Technical Skills
At the beginning of CMPE352, few of us had web development experience, let alone specialization in a topic. <br>
There were a few of us who had the knowledge of backend, mobile, and frontend, and from time to time we had tutorial sessions in the team. <br>
At the end of CMPE451, all of the group contributed to the application, some of us learning the frameworks from knowing nothing and being able to come up with the desired product. <br>
The least of all, every group member became better at some aspect of web development. <br>
## Customer Interaction
One of the things the Group 2 did the best is probably interacting with the customer. <br>
We, as a team, know that we could enhance different aspects of the final product further, but knowing that we have a limited budget in terms of time and workforce, <br>
we managed the customer expectation and delivered almost all of the requirements just in time. <br>
We were careful enough to look out for the borders that were drawn by the customers, in terms of time, product, deliverables and further. <br>
One of the things the process thought us is: It is very important to deliver what is being asked for: Nothing more is required, nothing less is acceptable. <br>

## Final Product
At the end of the day, the experience we had and learnings along the journey led to our investment platform, **TrAiders**. <br>
In terms of specialty, we have learned new things in economics and the investment world. The final product has all the functionalities being asked for in the requirements. <br>
Users can make investments, track their investments, track the economic state in the parities, can read comments and articles, can follow events and interact with other users through different media. <br>
The system also has <text, image> to <text,image> annotations, which is using the W3C protocol, and that system running on a different server as well. <br>

## Final Comments
One of the very important lessons that the process thought us is attention to detail. <br>
Simply just by paying attention to customer's words or what is written on the paper can lead to great satisfaction. <br>
One can find these details in any part of the TrAiders product: The avatars, the ease of use for the users, the annotation system being run exactly by the customer's description. <br>
We, as Group 2 are very happy with the final product that we have, but most importantly the teamwork and friendship we have built throughout the journey, and everyone having value added to their lives. <br>

**1- GitHub Wiki:**
We are updating our wiki page as needed, pushing meeting notes and keeping everything from requirements to group members updated on there.

**2- GitHub Issues & PRs:**
We still use our previous convention. All can be traced in the repo. Everyone creates their own issue, people should not be closing their issue without the review of at least 2 other people, preferably from the same team. Issue Templates and PR templates are used during the creation. As a new thing, we left using Travis as our continuous integration tool and we started to use GitHub Actions.

**3- Meeting Notes:**
Meeting notes are still accessible through the wiki page.
We are always utilizing those to refer to action items, remember our agenda and goals.

**4- Requirements:**
We have rarely updated our requirements so far, but we always keep reviewing them during the implementation phase.

**5- Mockups:**
You can visit the [mockups section](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2019group2/wiki/Mockups) to see all the mockups we've done so far.

**6- Design Diagrams:**
We finalized the implementation, but there will still be updates as needed. Final version of the class diagrams can be found at this page [page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2019group2/wiki/Class-Diagram). 

**7- Project Plan:**
Project plan can also be found below. As mentioned previously, we have decided to take a requirement oriented approach.
Thus in the project plan, the tabs refer to our requirements. Each week we plan to implement a couple of those.

**8- API:**
Traiders API can be accessed at [api.traiders.tk](//api.traiders.tk). 

**9- API Documentation:**
Traiders API documentations can be accessed at [api.traiders.tk/docs](//api.traiders.tk/docs) [api.traiders.tk/redocs](//api.traiders.tk/redocs)

**10- Deployment and Security:**
We frequently deployed our application's latest version throughout the development process so that it would always be up to date. In addition to that we deployed an annotation server to bring annotation support to our application. Annotation server is independent from Traiders servers and can be accessed at [https://annotation.traiders.tk/](//annotation.traiders.tk/).

**11- Web Project, Frontend:**
Our web application is up and running at [traiders.tk](//traiders.tk). Users can register, sign in, choose an avatar, list & view & like & comment (on) articles, list & tracks events, list & follow users, list & view & comment (on) equipment, list & see details with charts for several parities in different category, add assets, make investments, create & follow portfolios, making text or image annotations for articles, sign-up or sign-in with Google, make semantic search. get recommendations, see notifications, 

**12- Mobile App:**
The latest version of our mobile application will always be downloadable at [traiders.tk/mobile](//traiders.tk/mobile).
Users can register, sign in, choose an avatar, list & view & like & comment (on) articles, list & track events, list & follow users, list & view & comment (on) equipment, list & see details for several parities in different category, sign-up or sign-in with Google,  create & delete alarms, create & list portfolios, make semantic search, get recommendations, see notifications, make text to text annotations for articles.

**13- Weekly Milestones:**
We continued to utilize milestone concept. As stated previously we tried to set weekly or biweekly custom milestones to increase efficiency in delivery and ease the management of the project per domain like backend, frontend, etc.

# Evaluation of tools and managing the project

## Backend
- **Amazon Web Services:** We use an AWS EC2 instance to deploy the backend side of our application.
- **Django and Django Rest Framework:** We use Django Rest Framework on top of Django. As opposed to the practice application that we developed in CMPE352, we use DRF's viewsets and serializers more often. Together they enable automatic schema generation which helps to readily produce an extensive API documentation as we develop.
- **Docker and Docker Compose:** All of our application services (nginx, database, WSGI server for backend, Node.js server for frontend) are containerized and configurable in the source code by using Dockerfiles. This helps us to define the environments in which our services run in the source code and also automate the deployment process.
- **Gunicorn**: Gunicorn is a WSGI server for production. We use it to be able to serve as many clients as possible at the same time by configuring it to use multiple workers.
- **Let's Encrypt:** We got our SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. We use HTTPs for all web communications.
- **Nginx:** We use nginx as a router to direct coming requests to either the backend or the frontend application depending on the subdomain. Nginx also serves the static and media content such as CSS files or images.
- **Pycharm:** Pycharm is great for both coding and version control. Some features we use often are: automatic code reformatting, navigate to declaration/usage, debugging and GUI support for testing.
- **Redoc & Swagger:** We provide two different UI options for API documentation. Redoc and Swagger take the OpenAPI schema generated by DRF and turn it into an human-readable interface.
- **Travis:** We use Travis CI for style checking and testing. It helps us maintain a clean and working codebase.
- **PostgresSQL:** We think a relational database work better for our project as we will implement many components that tightly relate to each other.

## Frontend
- **Amazon Web Services:** We use an AWS EC2 instance to deploy the frontend side of our application.
- **React Javascript Framework:** The main framework to implement the Frontend side of the project.
- **Eslint-stylelint** Eslint a tool which applies the rule for AIRBNB code style. It helps to achieve readability for the team.
- **Docker and Docker Compose:** Docker is a platform to build, share, and run applications with containers which helps in therms of flexibility, security, portability, scalability.
- **Travis:** Travis is used to test the commit in terms of styling, compatibility and checks whether the code commited is working properly or not.
- **Prettier:** Automatically formats the code which helps developers saving time and energy.
- **Redux:** Redux is a module which helps the data storing in React. In other words; it helps to fetch data from the api or post data to api in a more secure, consistent way.
- **Visual Studio Code:** The IDE used to coding in React.js environment.

## Mobile
- **Android Studio:** We use an Android Studio as our integrated development environment.
- **Java:** We implement our requirements via Java programming language.
- **Android Emulator:** Android emulator simulates Android devices on our computer so that we can test our application on a variety of devices and Android API levels without needing to have each physical device.
- **Gradle:** Gradle is an open-source build-automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration.
- **Material.io:** This website provides a design system that helps developers build high-quality digital experience. We try to follow the standards on this website. In addition to this, the icons we use in our application are taken from this website - all for free.
