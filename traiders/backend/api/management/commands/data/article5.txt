How I Built a Dividend Growth Investment Portfolio
I remember the first time I read Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. It was witty, it was entertaining, and it wasn't anything like your standard annual report with glossy pages, full color photos, and mind-numbing marketing-speak.

That first time, the page that blew me away was his list of stock investments – specifically the dividend producing stocks.

Berkshire Hathaway, as of the 2017 letter, owns 400 million shares of stock at a cost of $1.299 billion. Each share pays out $1.48 a year. Berkshire Hathaway gets $592 million from Coca Cola every single year.

That's an annual yield of 45.6%.

How is this possible!? What is this sorcery!?

Time is an investor's best friend.

Buffett acquired shares of Coca-Cola in 1988. Back then he wrote “We expect to hold these securities for a long time. In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever. We are just the opposite of those who hurry to sell and book profits when companies perform well but who tenaciously hang on to businesses that disappoint. Peter Lynch aptly likens such behavior to cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.” (1998 letter)

The formula is simple. He bought the shares a long time ago, his cost basis was much lower than the market value, and KO kept increasing dividends. If you buy shares today (at $41.62), you get 3.55% yield. Warren Buffett is getting 45.6%.

I wanted to replicate his success. I wanted to build a portfolio of blue chip, dividend stocks that would produce passive income for us.

I'll start with explaining where dividends fit in our existing portfolio, follow it up with a discussion why we invest in individuals stocks and not dividend funds, a brief chat about the factors in our favor followed by the strategy I use to pick stocks. Let's go!
