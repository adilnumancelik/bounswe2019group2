How To Build Wealth (It's Ridiculously Simple)
Building wealth is simple.

It doesn’t require luck, genius, or special connections.

You don’t have to attend overpriced weekend financial seminars or learn the latest tricks and gimmicks sold by slick marketers.

As John Bogle wisely stated, “The secret is there are no secrets.”

The truth behind how to build wealth is public domain knowledge, simple to understand, and nobody is going to get rich selling it to you.

In fact, it's so simple it can be explained in just two sentences:

1. Make more than you spend and invest the difference wisely.
2. Develop simple daily habits that result in wealth accumulation.
I know… you’re probably a little disappointed.

You wanted something new, different, and clever – the missing ingredient that has held you back and will produce breakthrough results. The fabled “secret” every marketer tries to sell.

Instead, I give you something dangerously close to what Grandma would have said.

But listen to the voice of experience. I’ve coached hundreds of people from debtors to the wealthy, and the pattern is unmistakable.

And it’s not just me singing this song. These same truths were taught by Benjamin Franklin hundreds of years earlier and reiterated by numerous authorities ever since, including J. Paul Getty.

It's timeless wisdom that has been proven over the centuries, and will also probably work for you (if you just put it into practice).

In short, if you want wealth in this lifetime with the highest probability of success, then these two sentences contain the essential wisdom you need to know.
