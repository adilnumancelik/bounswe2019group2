Why Invest in Index Funds?
The following is an adapted, excerpted chapter from the 2018 edition of my book Investing Made Simple: Investing in Index Funds Explained in 100 Pages or Less.

Pay less for a product or service, and you’ll have more money left over afterwards. Pretty straightforward, right? For some reason, many investors seem to think that this rule doesn’t apply to the field of investing. Big mistake.

INDEX FUNDS 101

A bit of background: Most mutual funds are run by people picking stocks or other investments that they think will earn above-average returns. Index funds, however, are passively managed. That is, they seek only to match (rather than beat) the performance of a given index.

For example, index funds could be used to track the performance of:

The entire U.S. stock market,
- Certain sectors of the U.S. stock market (the pharmaceutical industry, for instance),
- Various international stock markets,
- The bond market of a given country, or
- Just about anything else you can think of.


Most Actively Managed Funds Lose.

The goal of most actively managed funds is to earn a return greater than that of their respective indexes. For example, many actively managed U.S. stock funds seek to outperform the return of the U.S. stock market. After all, if an active fund doesn’t beat its index, then its investors would have been better off in an index fund that simply tracks the market’s return.

Interestingly, most investors actually would be better off in index funds. Why? Because — due to the high costs of active management — the majority of actively managed funds fail to outperform their respective indexes. In fact, according to a study done by Standard and Poors, for the ten-year period ending 6/30/2017:

- Less than 15% of U.S. stock funds managed to outperform their respective indexes,
- Less than 21% of international stock funds managed to outperform their respective indexes, and
- Less than 23% of taxable bond funds managed to outperform their respective indexes.

Now, lest you think that this particular period was an anomaly, let me assure you: It wasn’t. Standard and Poors has been doing this study since 2002, and each of the studies has shown very similar results. Actively managed funds have failed in both up markets and down markets. They’ve failed in both domestic markets and international markets. And they’ve failed in both stock markets and bond markets.

Why Index Funds Win

The investments included in a given index are generally published openly, thereby making it easy for an index fund to track its respective index. (All the fund has to do is buy all of the stocks — or other investments — that are included in the index.) As you can imagine, implementing such a strategy can be done at a far lower cost than that charged by the average actively managed fund.

Common sense (and elementary school arithmetic) tells us that:
- If the entire stock market earns, say, a 9% annual return over a given decade, and
- The average dollar invested in the stock market incurs investment costs (such as brokerage commissions and mutual fund fees) of 1.5%,
