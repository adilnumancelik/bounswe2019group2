British Pound Sterling to Euro exchange rate: Travellers can benefit from strong pound after Tory victory

THE POUND to euro exchange rate remained at a modest high following on from last week’s Conservative Party landslide General Election 2019 win. How will the boosted rates affect holidaymakers?

The pound has settled at a modest position just below the more than three-year high it struck last week. Although it experienced a minor dip on Friday, sterling remains in a comfortable position, which should be beneficial to tourists hoping to change their holiday money in the coming days. Moving forward, politics will remain the deciding factor of the pound’s position.

The pound is currently trading at a rate of 1.2039 against the euro according to Bloomberg at the time of writing.

It is a minor fall from its surge last week following the announcement of a Tory majority.

Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk this morning, Michael Brown, Senior Market Analyst, at Caxton FX said: “Sterling experienced a modest pullback on Friday, paring roughly half of its post-election advance, in something of a buy the rumour, sell the fact reaction to the Tories’ majority.

“Nonetheless, the pound closed close to the €1.20 handle, just below a more than three-year high against the common currency.

“This week, while politics will remain in focus, investors will also receive a full health-check on the UK economy, including the latest employment, inflation, retail sales, and GDP reports.”
