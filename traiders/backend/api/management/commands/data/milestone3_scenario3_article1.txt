Pound Turkish Lira (GBP/TRY) Exchange Rate Dips, UK Construction Output Suffers in October

The Pound Turkish Lira (GBP/TRY) exchange rate eased today, with the pairing currently trading around ₺7.352 after the UK Construction PMI for October remained firmly in contraction territory at 44.2, dampening market confidence in the British economy.

British political news remains in focus, and while the Tories are expected to secure their lead in the polls, analysts remain cautious about predictions for a hung parliament on 12 December, leaving the GBP/TRY exchange rate subdued on rising uncertainty.

The Turkish Lira (TRY) edged higher against a weakened Pound (GBP) following this morning’s Turkish inflation figure for October, which rose from 0.99% to 2% on the month, while deteriorating to 8.55% on the year.

However, after the credit ratings agency Fitch revised Turkey’s economic outlook from “negative” to “stable” last week, appetite for the Turkish Lira increased.

In political news, Turkey’s Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan may call off his visit to Washington next week in protest of proposed sanctions on Turkey. As a result, we could see the Turkish Lira begin to lose some of its gains on heightened political uncertainty in the near term.

Any signs of a flare-up between Turkey and the US could diminish appetite in the Turkish Lira, as this would exacerbate an already volatile political situation and weaken the Turkish economy.

Pound traders will be awaiting tomorrow’s release of October’s UK Markit Services PMI, which is expected to remain in recession territory at 49.7.

Tomorrow will also see the publication of October’s UK BRC Like-For-Like Retail Sales, which are expected to improve from -1.7% to 1.4%.
